# V2

In this folder I am going to use detectron2

So this would be better than V1

`BASE_LR=0.0001`

`EVAL_PERIOD=5000`

`MAX_ITER=3250`

`MODEL=COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml`

`IMS_PER_BATCH=1`

`BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE=32`

`SCORE_THRESH_TEST=0.625`


For parameter tunning all of the models and base_lrs and other metrics it will take around 24 Hours.

I am still waiting for a long time to train the model.
